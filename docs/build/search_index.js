For example, look at the  \"2-skeletons\" word in the docstring of LARLIB.skel_merge:cuboidGrid(shape::Array{Int64,1}[, full=false])::Union{LAR,LAR_Model}Monospace is used for everything code related. Look e.g. at \"Points\",  \"Cells\" and \"Hpc\" in the definition docstring of mkpol:mkpol(verts::Points, cells::Cells)::Hpcnote: Note\nIn Julia REPL the monospace text is the one colored differently. In a terminal you will see something like:   (Image: Julia REPL monospace exaple)"

    "text": "Visualization of geometric and/or topological data is a must for a project that concerns geometric modeling, numerical simulations, and/or graphics rendering of simulation results. The LARVIEW.jl package provides visualization services to LARLIB.jl, the julia ongoing implementation of the LAR (Linear Algebraic Representation) scheme for solid and geometric modeling, well-based on linear algebra and algebraic concepts of cellular and chain complexes.  LARLIB is implemented using only dense and sparse arrays, and without need of fancy complicated data structures that are usual for non-manifold solid modeling. LAR has a large semantic coverage,  including geometric and topological modeling, domain modeling for physical simulations, geographical mapping, computer graphics, computer vision and robotics.Visualization of data structures generated by the Julia package LARLIB are currently generated by making use of the Python package pyplasm, the current implementation of the geometric language PLaSM (Programming LAnguage for Solid Modeling). See the Wiley\'s book  Geometric Programming for Computer-Aided Design for more information."
